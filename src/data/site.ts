 *

 *  documents (docs/decisions.md, docs/01-pricing-guide.md,
 *  projects/summitstudio/buiness-blueprint.md, docs/sales-system.md) —
 *  nothing here is invented. Where a document didn't establish a fact
 *  (a phone number, a founding team bio, a client count), it's left out
 *  rather than fabricated, per Decision 010's spirit applied to the
 *  agency's own identity, not just client reviews.

    {
      question: 'Do I have to commit to anything before I see my website?',
      answer:
        'No. We build a working demo first using information that’s already public about your business. You’ll receive a real website on a real link before you’re asked to sign anything or pay a dollar. If you don’t like it, there’s no obligation to move forward.',
    },
    {
      question: 'Why is this so much faster than a typical web agency?',
      answer:
        'We don’t start every project from a blank page. Instead, we build every website on a proven system we’ve refined specifically for landscaping businesses. That lets us spend time customizing your business instead of rebuilding the same foundations over and over. You still receive revisions before launch — it just doesn’t take months to get there.',
    },
    {
      question: 'Why are your prices lower than most agencies?',
      answer:
        'Because we’ve standardized the process instead of reinventing it every time. Most agencies bill dozens of hours for planning, mockups, and custom development before you ever see a website. We skip that overhead by using a proven system and showing you a working demo first.',
    },

      question: 'Will my website look like everyone else’s?',
      answer:
        'No. Every site is built on the same design system, but the content, services, service areas, branding, photos, colors, reviews, and messaging are specific to your business. Think of it like homes built from the same architectural plans — each one still feels unique because of how it’s finished.',
