    {
      question: 'How is this so much faster than a typical web agency?',
      answer:
        'We work from one proven template system rather than designing every site from a blank page, and we build your demo before any contract exists — so there’s no lengthy discovery phase before you see something real. The finished site still gets a genuine review and revision round; it just doesn’t take months to get there.',
    },
    {
      question: 'Do I have to commit to anything before I see my website?',
      answer:
        'No. We build a working demo first, using information that’s already public about your business. You look at the actual site, on a real link, before you agree to anything.',
    },
    {
      question: 'Are you an established agency, or a new one?',
      answer:
        'We’re new — we haven’t hidden that, and we won’t start now. What that means in practice: every plan is priced the same for our first client as our hundredth, with no early-adopter discount that quietly disappears later, and the whole process is built around proving the work before you commit anything — a real, working demo, not a portfolio and a promise. Judge the actual site we build for you, not a track record.',
    },
    {
      question: 'Do I own my website?',
      answer:
        'Yes, for Starter and Growth — once the setup fee is paid, the site and its content are yours, and your domain is always yours regardless of plan. Website Care works differently: since there’s no setup fee, the website remains part of the managed service while you’re subscribed, rather than transferring to you outright. Ask about a buyout if you’d rather own a copy of the site on Website Care.',
    },
    {
      question: 'Can I upgrade later?',
      answer:
        'Yes. Moving from Starter to Growth costs only the difference between the two setup fees ($1,000) — you already paid for and own the Starter build, so you’re not charged for it twice.',
    },
    {
      question: 'What happens if I cancel Website Care?',
      answer:
        'Because Website Care never charged a setup fee, the site stays part of the managed service rather than transferring to you the way a paid-in-full Starter or Growth site does. If you’d like to keep the site instead of continuing the plan, ask us about a buyout.',
    },
    {
      question: 'Can I move my site to another developer or host later?',
      answer:
        'On Starter and Growth, yes to a real degree — you own your domain independent of us, and once your setup fee is paid in full you own your site’s content and the site as deployed, so you can point your domain elsewhere and take it with you. (Website Care works differently — see “Do I own my website?” above.) What never transfers, on any plan, is the underlying Summit Studio template system itself — the design system and code that power every client’s site. A new developer would be picking up your deployed site, not our internal engine, to build from there.',
    },
    {
      question: 'Can I host the site myself instead of through Summit Studio?',
      answer:
        'While you’re on an active plan, no — hosting, security, and support are bundled into the monthly fee and managed by us, which is part of what keeps the cost low and your side of it hands-off. Your domain is always yours independent of hosting, though, so you’re never locked in: on Starter or Growth you can point it to any host you choose if you leave. On Website Care, remember it’s the site itself — not just the hosting — that stays part of the managed service unless you buy it out.',
    },
    {
      question: 'What happens to my website if Summit Studio ever stops operating?',
      answer:
        'Your domain is always yours, regardless of plan or payment status — we never hold it hostage, and that’s true from day one. On Starter and Growth, once your setup fee is paid in full you also own your site’s content and the deployed site itself, so you wouldn’t be left with nothing. We’re a new studio without years of operating history to point to yet, and we’d rather say that plainly than promise something we can’t back up.',
    },
    {
      question: 'What does the price actually include?',
      answer:
        'A finished, mobile-responsive website built on the Summit Studio template, with the services and service-area pages your package includes, a working contact form, SEO metadata, hosting and support already bundled into the monthly fee, and a revision round before launch. See the Pricing page for exactly what’s in each plan.',
    },
    {
      question: 'Do you design a custom site, or do I get a template?',
      answer:
        'Every site is built on one proven Summit Studio design system rather than designed from a blank page each time — that’s what makes the fast turnaround and fixed pricing possible. Within that system, your site is built from your real business details, services, service area, and photos, not generic placeholder content. It’s a shared engine, not a shared site.',
    },
    {
      question: 'Is there a contract for ongoing hosting?',
      answer:
        'Starter and Growth are cancel-anytime, no lock-in. Website Care is the one exception — a 12-month agreement, which is what makes its zero-upfront-cost pricing work. A business that feels trapped doesn’t refer anyone else, so we keep that the exception, not the rule.',
    },
    {
      question: 'What if I want changes after launch?',
      answer:
        'Website Care includes unlimited minor text/image updates. On Starter or Growth, any change — however small — gets a quick, flat-fee or hourly quote before we start, so you always know the cost up front.',
    },
    {
      question: 'Do you only build for landscaping businesses?',
      answer:
        'Landscaping and lawn care is where we’ve built and proven the process so far. If you run a different single-location home-service business, get in touch — it may already fit, or it’s a short conversation about custom scope.',
    },
    {
      question: 'How long does the real build take once I sign on?',
      answer:
        'Typically 3–5 business days after your deposit clears and your materials (photos, service details, logo if you have one) are complete — longer if materials arrive late, since the timeline starts from when we have everything, not from the deposit alone.',
